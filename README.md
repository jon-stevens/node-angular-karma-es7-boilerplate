This is a boilerplate project I created to get apps/spikes/ideas up and running quickly. 

It is a node project with a dummy angular app, webpack, sass, and es6.
It also has some dummy tests set up to get you started.

to run app 
 `npm start` (run `npm i` the first time)

to compile css/js
 `npm run css`
 `npm run js`
 
 to run tests
 
  `nm test`
